Starting Out with Python 4e - MPL Assignments

Pearson has created a rather ineffective, frustrating homework system. This repository is being created with the single purpose of allowing people to check their work and is only for educational use.

Try to do the assignments yourself first!! You won't learn anything by copying and pasting.

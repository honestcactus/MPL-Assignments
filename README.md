Starting Out with Python 4e - MPL Assignments

Pearson has created a rather ineffective, frustrating homework system. This repository is being created with the single purpose of allowing people to check their work and is only for educational use.

Try to do the assignments yourself first!! You won't learn anything by copying and pasting.
# For this reason, the answers will be *images only*. The questions will be listed as text so that they can be indexed by systems, but it is up to ***you*** to figure out the differences.

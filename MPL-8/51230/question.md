Suppose there is a class Alarm. Alarm has two class variables, code which contains a String value representing the code that deactivates the alarm, and armed which contains a boolean describing whether or not the alarm is activated. 
Alarm has a function arm that takes no parameters and changes the value of armed to False. Call the arm function on the Alarm object myAlarm.
